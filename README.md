# Data-Wrangleing

(Data wrangling)

•

Gathering data:The first step in gathering data I open the

file and read it. I look at the data information and see the

names of the columns and all the information that will help

me in the next step. Then I request to read the URL file that

contains the image predictions. The final step I open JSON

files

•

Assessing data: In this section, I notice that there is a lot

of missing data that I will delete the missing data in the

cleaning section. In the image files, the name columns had

wrong names.

•

Cleaning data: In this section, I had to find Quality Issues

and Tidiness Issues.
